1. How web browsers function:
   Web browsers act as intermediaries between users and web servers. When a user enters a web address or clicks on a link, the browser sends a request to the corresponding server. The server responds by sending back HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which the browser then interprets and displays as a visual web page.

2. Define and describe DOM:
   The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface provided by web browsers. It represents the structure of web documents as a hierarchical tree, where each element in the document is a node in the tree. Developers can use the DOM to access, modify, and manipulate elements and attributes on a web page dynamically using scripting languages like JavaScript.

3. Difference between HTML, XML, and XHTML:
   HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for structuring content on web pages. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language for defining custom document structures and data formats. XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) is a reformulation of HTML in XML syntax, enforcing stricter rules for document validity and compatibility with XML-based tools.

4. Four essential elements your HTML pages need:
   Every HTML page should include a document type declaration (<!DOCTYPE html>), the <html> element to encapsulate the entire document, a <head> section containing metadata and resources like stylesheets and scripts, and a <body> section containing the main content of the page visible to users.

5. Purpose of the index.html page and its location:
   The "index.html" page serves as the default or home page of a website. It is the initial page displayed to users when they visit the website's main URL (e.g., www.example.com). The "index.html" file is typically located in the root directory of the website's file structure.

6. Best naming practices:
   Good naming practices involve choosing descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, files, and other elements in code. Names should be concise yet expressive, avoiding ambiguity and conveying the purpose or functionality clearly. Consistency in naming conventions, avoiding reserved words, and using lowercase for filenames and URLs are also essential for maintainability and readability.

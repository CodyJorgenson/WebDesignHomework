        <p> The legendary <span id="kangs">Arthur</span> developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's 
            fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). Geoffrey depicted <span id="kangs">Arthur</span> 
            as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established a vast empire. Many elements and incidents that are now an 
            integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the magician 
            Merlin, Arthur's wife Guinevere, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's conception at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at 
            Camlann, and final rest in Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chr√©tien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail 
            to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French 
            stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round 
            Table. The themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend vary widely from text to text, and there is no one canonical 
            version. <span id="kangs">Arthurian</span> literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed, until it experienced a 
            major resurgence in the 19th century. </p>

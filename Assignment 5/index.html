      <h1>Copy Pasta</h1>
      <p>Navy Seal</p>

      <p>The Navy Seal copypasta, also sometimes known as Gorilla Warfare due to a misspelling of <br />
         "guerrilla warfare" in its contents, is an aggressive but humorous attack paragraph supposedly <br />
         written by an extremely well-trained member of the United States Navy SEALs (hence its name) to an <br />
         unidentified "kiddo", ostensibly whoever the copypasta is directed to. Written in a manner similar to a <br />
         non-serious death threat, the copypasta has the author threaten the recipient while boasting of their own <br />
         increasingly absurd or unfeasible accomplishments, such as having "over 300 confirmed kills" or being able to <br />
         kill someone "in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands". This copypasta is often reposted <br />
         as a humorous overreaction to an insult and is thought to have originated on the military-themed imageboard <br />
         OperatorChan, although the earliest known usage of the copypasta was on 4chan on November 11th, 2010.[4]</p>
